Partially Correct: Writes only one correct equation or writes the equations with minor errors. Incorrect: Fails to set up the equations properly or makes significant computational mistakes.\n- [Q15_tangent_condition] Apply the tangent condition (the circle is tangent to the line x - y = 1) to derive a relationship between the center coordinates. (Max Score: 1)\n    Partial Credit: Correct: Properly uses the tangent condition either through the distance from the center to the line (distance = r) or by using the slope relation (the radius at the point of tangency is perpendicular to the tangent line), and formulates the correct relation (e.g., (b-1)/(a-2) = -1). Partially Correct: Uses the tangent condition but makes an algebraic or conceptual error in formulating the relationship.

(Max Score: 1)\n    Partial Credit: Correct: Solves the equations correctly to obtain a = 3 and b = 0. Partially Correct: Arrives at one correct coordinate while the other is incorrect, or produces an expression that is close to correct but not fully simplified. Incorrect: Fails to solve for the center or provides irrelevant or mistaken values.\n- [Q15_find_radius] Determine the radius r using one of the circle equations after finding the center. (Max Score: 1)\n    Partial Credit: Correct: Substitutes the correct center into one of the equations and calculates r = √2, so r² = 2. Partially Correct: Uses the center to solve for r but makes a minor arithmetic error resulting in the wrong r value. Incorrect: Does not determine the radius correctly or omits this step.\n- [Q15_final_equation] Write the final equation of the circle in standard form.

  ""comments"": ""The teacher analysis is clear in its outline but very brief. It indicates the overall strategy for both parts of the problem but does not show the detailed expansion or intermediary steps needed for a complete understanding. The coverage is adequate in that all proof components are mentioned, yet the analysis could benefit from more explicit demonstrations to guide the student. There is consistency with the rubric in that it mentions the essential inequality properties and the use of the sum condition. However, the explanation is not fully complete; important algebraic steps (like the square expansions) are only hinted at. The treatment appears fair in expecting students to justify the steps themselves without over-prescribing every detail."",
  ""recommendations"": ""Include more detailed algebraic demonstrations (for example, explicitly showing the expansion of (√a + √b)² and (√c + √d)²) and clarify the logical transitions.
